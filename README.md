### Application Principles
- A better JavaScript ES6 syntax ( arrow functions, ternary operators, object destructuring and others! )
- React ( Presentational and Container Components ) 
- Redux ( State Management with our action creators, reducers, and store )
- Ant Design for a better UX & UI with Responsive Web Design
- SASS ( using node-sass into our application managing styles becomes easy )
- Yarn ( A fast and asynchronous dependency manager for our projects )
